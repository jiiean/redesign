# Reimaging the BlueDot Observatory Visualization

This Project aims to redesign AWS’ BlueDot Observatory Visualization particularly focusing on understanding. Unlike the original, which requires the viewer to read a lot of background information, this redesign focuses on clarity and allows them to receive the same message BlueDot tries to send directly from the labels.
