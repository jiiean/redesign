# Reimaging the BlueDot Observatory Visualization

This Project aims to redesign AWS’ BlueDot Observatory Visualization particularly focusing on understanding. Unlike the original, which requires the viewer to read a lot of background information, this redesign focuses on clarity and allows them to receive the same message BlueDot tries to send directly from the labels.

## SDG Goal Contribution

My project works with SDG goal 6.

![E_WEB_06](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee55b178-6a47-41c4-8508-c4e4fc7ccef3)

 Goal 6 focuses on clean water and sanitation with a focus on ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. My project targets the availability portion of this goal to highlight how water levels have been dropping. It bring environmental awareness to the real problem of drinking water and promotes change.
